In this configuration the AO system is working in closed loop. If the measurements of the wavefront is not used as a control feedback, the system is working in open loop. In the standard setup we offer a deformable lens or mirror controlled by a controller and a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWFS) for the feedback.</description></item><item><title>Wavefront Measurement</title><link>/userguide/wavefront-measurement.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/userguide/wavefront-measurement.html</guid><description>An accurate wavefront measurement is the starting point for a succesful adaptive optics correction. Follow this tutorial to grasp the basics of wavefront sensing within PhotonLoop.
Sub-optimal measurement settings have a detrimental impact on the correction quality and might lead to an unstable system behavior.
Configure the sensor The first step to perform a measurement is to configure the sensor from the sensor widget and visualize it in the viewfinder.</description></item><item><title>Aberration Correction</title><link>/userguide/compensation.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/userguide/compensation.html</guid><description>Calibration of the AO system After conjugation and definition of the grid it is possible to perform the calibration of the system. Not that the calibration and also AO functions need an accurate measurement of the wavefront. Before start be familiar with the wavefront measurement. Go in the Calibration Tab and you will find all the calibrations parameters. These parameters can be divided in three main blocks, as shown in the next figure.</description></item><item><title>TCP-IP</title><link>/userguide/tcpip.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/userguide/tcpip.html</guid><description>System Requirements PhotonLoop 1.5.8.3 (or later)
