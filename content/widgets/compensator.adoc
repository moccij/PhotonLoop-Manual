Within the *compensator settings* widget it is possible to choose the *control law*, its parameters and additional *robustness* settings.
Available compensators are listed as link:{{< ref "userguide/plugins#_compensator_plugins" >}}[*plugins*].

== Robustness

These parameters can help avoiding unexpected behaviors from the AO closed loop operations, such as to shut down the loop when the controller is self-oscillating or the sensor image is partially covered.
