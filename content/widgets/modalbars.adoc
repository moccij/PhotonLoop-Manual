The *modal bars* widget gives the user a graphical representation of the actual state of the modal reconstruction: 

* The *green* bars display the measured modes;
* The *light green* slimmer bars display the modal offsets;
* The *red* crosses indicate disabled modes.

A mode is *selected* when hovering over its corresponding bar. While hovering, the *preview snippet* shows the numerical values and mode wavefront representation of the currently selected mode index.

Within the *modes bars* widget it is possible to directly control the modes *offset* of the currently selected mode:

* Clicking the *left* mouse button changes the offset. 
* Clicking the *right* mouse button zeroes the offset. 
* Clicking the *middle* mouse button enables/disables the mode.

{{% notice tip %}}
It is possible to keep the mouse button *depressed* to keep editing the offset or reset multiple offsets.
{{% /notice %}}

== Settings

The *visualization settings* can be accessed by clicking on the icon:settings[] located on the *top right* of the bars plot.
