The *wavefront* widgets show the wavefront reconstructed from the measured modal terms.
Refer to the *modal settings* widget to set the shape and resolution of the reconstructed wavefront.

{{% notice note %}}
The widgets will be enabled once a valid *reference* has been taken.

|Item |Description

|Scale
|Scale of the colormap (in waves), from zero to either direction.
If the wavefront amplitude is greater/lower than the scale, the colormap wraps.
Does not apply when the representation type is Interferogram.

|Autoscale
|Dynamically scales the colormap to cover the entire amplitude of the wavefront.
Does not apply when the representation type is Interferogram.


|Colormap
|Colormap of the wavefront.

|Representation
a|Representation of the wavefront:

!Item !Description

!Phase !Phase representation;
!Interferogram !Interferogram representation;
!Smooth Interferogram !Interferogram representation, with additional smoothing (computationally expensive);
!PSF !Point Spread Function representation.
!===

|Interpolation
|Enables linear interpolation.

|Show Actuators
|Show the actuators positions and values over the wavefront surface.

{{% notice note %}}
The actuators positions are only available after a valid *calibration* has been performed/loaded.
