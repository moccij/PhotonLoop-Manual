The *wavefront* widget shows the wavefront reconstructed from the measured modal terms.
Refer to the *modal settings* widget to set the shape and resolution of the reconstructed wavefront.

{{% notice note %}}
The widget will be enabled once a valid *reference* has been taken.

|Item |Description

|Scale
|Scale of the colormap (in waves), from zero to either direction.
If the wavefront amplitude is greater/lower than the scale, the colormap wraps.
Does not apply when the representation type is Interferogram.

|Autoscale
|Dynamically scales the colormap to cover the entire amplitude of the wavefront.
Does not apply when the representation type is Interferogram.

|Type
a|Representation type of the wavefront:

!Off !The wavefront is disabled;
!Phase !Phase representation;
!Smooth Phase !Phase representation, with pixel-wise interpolation;
!Interferogram !Interferogram representation;
!Smooth Interferogram !Interferogram representation, with pixel-wise interpolation;
!Super Smooth Interferogram !Interferogram representation, with additional smoothing (computationally expensive);
!PSF !(Experimental) Point Spread Function (PSF) representation.
