The *Values* widgets are a family of widgets comprised of:

* Bars widget;
* Table widget;
* Image grid widget.

The goal of each widget is to expose values in a meaningful and interactive way. 

== Bars Widget

The *bars* widget shows values and offsets as interactive histogram plots: 

* The *wide* bars display the current values;
* The *slim* bars display the current offsets;
* The *red* crosses indicate disabled indexes.

An index is *selected* when hovering over its corresponding bar with the mouse cursor. While hovering, the *preview snippet* shows the numerical values and, if available, the image of the currently selected index.

Within the *bars* widget it is possible to directly control the *offsets* of the currently selected index:

* Clicking the *left* mouse button changes the offset. 
* Clicking the *right* mouse button zeroes the offset. 
* Clicking the *middle* mouse button enables/disables the index.

{{% notice tip %}}
It is possible to keep the mouse button *depressed* to keep editing the offset or reset multiple offsets.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice note %}}
Offsets and disabled indexes may not be shown due to the values nature.
