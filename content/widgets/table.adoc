== Editing the Table

The table view is useful to enter precise values for the desired indexes. There are also some utilities that can be exploited to ease the table editing:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|icon:power[]
|Enable/Disable offsets.

|icon:folder[]
|Load offsets from file.

|icon:pencil[]
|Save current dataset to file.

|icon:restoreDefault[]
|Set to zero all offsets.
