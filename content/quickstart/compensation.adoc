PhotonLoop connects to both wavefront sensor and corrector, providing the means of compensating measured aberrations.
This tutorial will show how to correctly carry out the AO calibration of the AO system and succesfully close the control loop.

== Configure the WFC

The WaveFront Controller (WFC) is the optical deformable element in charge of the wavefront manipulation. It is managed within the xref:{{% param widgetsDir %}}/wfc.adoc[*wfc settings widget*]:

image:0 - Open WFC Detail.png[]

. Connect the WFC to the computer (refer to the xref:/userguide/installation.adoc[*installation*] guide on how to do it);
. Load the WFC profile from the WFC men√π. The profile is shipped along with the provided WFC device;

Only edit the WFC parameters if specifically instructed to do so.
{{% /notice %}}
. Energize the physical device; 
. Open the WFC by clicking on the icon:wfc_device[] button.
. Apply the Flat Commands icon:vflat[] to flatten the WFC.

If the steps were succesful, the WFC related widgets are now active. 
Test the WFC by either performing a relax routine using the Relax icon:wfc_relax[] button or manually moving actuators using the xref:{{% param widgetsDir %}}/actuatorsbars.adoc[*actuators bars widget*]. The WFC response should be observed within the xref:{{% param widgetsDir %}}/wavefront.adoc[*wavefront widget*].

== Configure the AO reconstructor

The AO system must be calibrated as a whole before attempting to close the control loop. The calibration consists in gathering the actuators response to poke patterns (i.e. interaction matrix), yielding to a map from the WFC shape to the measured wavefront:

. Check the calibration settings from within the xref:{{% param widgetsDir %}}/calibration.adoc[*calibration settings widget*];
. Start the calibration with the Perform Calibration icon:wfc_calibration[] command;
+
image:2 - Calibration.png[]
. The resulting actuators responses are shown in the xref:{{% param widgetsDir %}}/actuatorsresponse.adoc[*actuators response widget*].

To map a target wavefront to the WFC shape, the interaction matrix must be pseudo-inverted into the control matrix. PhotonLoop exploits the Singular Values Decomposition (SVD) to reveal the interaction matrix rank and manipulate the resulting system modes:

- The system modes are shown in xref:{{% param widgetsDir %}}/systemmodes.adoc[*system modes widget*], whereas the singular values are shown in the xref:{{% param widgetsDir %}}/singularbars.adoc[*system modes bars widget*];
- Advanced reconstructor settings are listed in the xref:{{% param widgetsDir %}}/reconstructor.adoc[*reconstructor settings widget*].

From the xref:{{% param widgetsDir %}}/compensator.adoc[*compensator settings widget*], select a compensator plugin and then close the loop with the icon:loop_closed[] command.
{{% notice warning %}}
By default, smaller system modes are removed from the reconstructor, and the compensator gain is low. While such initial parameters were proven to be safe for the average AO system, care must be taken to avoid instabilities. 
{{% /notice %}}

It is possible to tweak the number of considered system modes and the compensator gain to achieve higher temporal and spatial performance. The xref:{{% param widgetsDir %}}/timeseries.adoc[*time series widgets*] can be consulted to evaluate the performance in real-time.

The correlation graph is shown by entering in the Inspect calibration icon:. This graph reveals graphically the degree of orthogonality of the elements. If the diagonal is well defined it means that we have a good separation.

{{% notice tip %}}
Smaller singular values are associated to poorly represented system modes (affected by noise, unreachable) that might cause instabilities and are as such removed from the reconstructor. However, removing too many modes lowers the achievable spatial resolution.

You can save the calibration in the log window, when you take a snapshot the control matrix and influence function will be saved in the specified folder. You can load the calibration with Load Calibration button.

Each mode of the mirror/lens has its own gain that is related to the dynamic range used by the deformable element to generate the mode itself. Low order modes have a higher gain, it means that the system will use a smaller dynamic range to generate that mode. The last modes with a smaller gain belong to high order and they require a lot of dynamic when the deformable element try to reproduce them. Once the Calibration is terminated the program will automatically display the System tab showing the SVDfootnote:[SVD: singular value decomposition. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition] window accessible from the right of the main page.

When the histogram is displayed the modes can be added or removed using the SVD modes selection block:

* Leave Remove Piston unselected. This setting must be selected before performing the calibration and only in the case of mirrors that integrates the Piezo-Stack technology.
* Select Remove Global Tilt if you wish to exclude tip-tilt mode from the calibration.
* System modes are the number of modes selected from the user.
* SVD threshold set a threshold on the SVD gain in percentage. Below this value the modes are neglected.
* SVD threshold set a threshold on the SVD gain in percentage. Below this value the modes are neglected.
* Clicking on Discrete Selection of System Modes the user can remove (restore) selected modes clicking on the bars of the representation with the right (left).
* Clicking on Reset Selection of System Modes the user will restore all the removed discrete modes.

Here in the figure below you can see an example of a System modes diagram without the SVD mode selection (left) and with the SVD threshold set to 10% and some discrete modes eliminated (right).

In this case is clear that deleting SVD modes reduce considerably the actuators efforts (red bars) but the optical quality of the wavefront is considerably reduced as well. In general, to preserve the optical quality increasing actuators dynamic, it is better to remove only the last SVD modes introducing only a threshold.


== Closed Loop


After the calibration it is possible to close the loop of the adaptive optic system. The wavefront data are used to control the deformable element. Go in the Controller Tab and Compensator Tab and you find the parameters for the controller. The parameters are:

* Ki is the gain of the control system integrator, it goes from 0 to 1, but it can be forced to be more than one, this may be useful for system with low latency value.
* Kb is the anti-wind-up of the integrator. It is important when actuators saturate. Without Kb the controller keeps on increase voltages over saturation value. Kb limits this effect deflating the exceeding voltage. In this way the controller is more reactive to exit the saturation zone. Initially set Kb to 0.
* KAis theintegrator leakage. The controller accumulates numerical errors while is working that cause voltage signal to be more and more high to compensate aberrations. Ka is a loss factors that deflates the integrator to keep the dynamic at the initial value. The cost of this actions is that the control system does not executes perfectly the set point. Initially set Ka to 1.

Set the Ki parameter to low value, this is the gain of the closed loop, a high value means fast response of the system but it can also introduce instability.

Be sure that the wavefront measurements is fine and then click on this icon icon:loop_closed[] to start the closed loop operation. The wavefront will be flatten down and you can read the residual RMS in the bottom right part of the main window in the wavefront reconstruction graph. Typical residual RMS value is around 0.04 waves.

In closed loop is possible to generate Zernike modes. Act on the mode value in the histogram or insert the mode value in the utilities window. The deformable element will produce the indicated mode with a maximum strength defined by the dynamic of the devices. Below we can see the generation of the astigmatism and coma.

For this figure the wavefront display option in the above figure is set to Real. Change the display option from the panel below the modes representation as described in the next figure.

image:/img/image57.png[]

The display options available to be selected are:

* Real (It will represent the real state of the wavefront)
* Both (it will display the wavefront considering the real wavefront with the offset subtracted)
* Offset (it will display the wavefront considering only the offset introduced by the user)

== Save flat voltage array and apply to device

When you start the closed loop PHOTONLOOP will try to produce a flat wavefront. When this condition is reached it is possible to save the value of actuators (we call it Vflat) that level the deformable optics to zero phase shift. Now click on this icon icon:log_snapshot[] and save the actuator value with the snapshot button.

image:/img/image59.png[]

To load the flat voltage array, go to Controller Tab and chose to load (icon:folder[]) the folder containing file with voltage vector then press Apply Vflat. The flat voltage settings will always be added to start from a better initial wavefront. To remove the voltage flat click again on Apply Vflat. The V~flat~ array can be used in Open Loop mode where you don√î√á√ñt use the wavefront as a control feedback, see next section. Click on Mode offsets or Actuators offset if you want to load the Zernike modes or the Actuators voltages that level the lens, respectively.

Another way to apply the Vflat is directly applying the actuator offsets from the saved file actuators .txt that can be found in the Vflat folder. In order to do so, go to Utilities then select Actuators Panel and then load (icon:folder[]) the actuators.txt file present in the Vflat folder. After icon:power[] is pressed the actuators offset will be applied. And the lens will be flat. This method can be used also to load the actuators voltages for any kind of pre-generated and saved optical deformation of the lens.

== Open Loop

*If you do NOT have the wavefront sensor start here*, (if you have the wavefront sensor skip this section). Go to WFS tab and in the menu of the driver choose File sensor Vx.x. From Version 1.5.1 select Test sensor. Then press the camera connection button and select any white image in .jpg format of any size. Draw a new grid, select a circle aperture and start the measurements. To operate the system without the wavefront sensor feedback you have to upload the preset voltage flat (V~flat)~ and the influence functions. 1) Load the voltage set of the actuator that flatten the deformable element as describe above. 2) Go to Calibration, press Load calibration and select the folder where your calibration has been saved. The press relax and press open loop button and the wavefront will be flat, see figure below:

image:/img/image63.png[]

Now, as in the case of closed loop, clicking on the green histogram you can change the modes offsets and generate it. Few examples are shown below for coma term (In this measure the wavefront sensor was used only as observer):

image:/img/image64.png[]

and for trefoil:

image:/img/image65.png[]

You can also use the Utilities Modes to select the modes inserting the values manually. The amount are in waves RMS.

*If you have the wavefront sensor start here*

Just click on the open loop button an interact with the Zernike modes histogram to generate the wavefront shape that you desire.
