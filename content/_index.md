![PhotonLoop](PhotonLoop_logo_big.png)

PhotonLoop is a high performance **wavefront measurement and correction software**. 

It interfaces to the **Shack-Hartmann** WaveFront Sensor (WFS) and the WaveFront Corrector (WFC) consisting in **deformable mirrors or lenses**.
All the operations are aided with a friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
Using it with hardware components provided by Dynamic Optics allows to easily to create an **Adaptive Optics** (AO) system able to work in many applications such as: 

* Communication system;
* High power lasers;
* Microscopy;
* Ophthalmology;
* Astronomy. 

PhotonLoop can work up to 1kHz and offers the possibility of **data logging** and **remote control** (with TCP-IP).

In this manual we describe the main functions of the software making reference to a typical setup for adaptive optics. 
We will describe its use using snapshots. 
As an adaptive optics setup is very demanding a fine tuning, please contact us if necessary.
