== Files

In the Folder TCP_IP_PhotonLoop1.5.8.3:

* PhotonLoopCommunication.dll C comunication library
* PhotonLoopCommunication_lib.m MATLAB comunication library
* PhotonLoopCommunication_interface.m MATLAB and lib.thunk interface
* PhotonLoopCommunication_thunk_pcwin64.dll MATLAB and C library interface
* TCPIPExample.m MATLAB example

Here it is described the step by step procedure to modify the actuators of a deformable mirror with TCP-IP protocol without measuring or monitoring the wavefront in PhotonLoop.

Refer to PhotonLoop and QuickstartGuide provided manuals for further details. You can find these manuals in the provided USB stick.

== Connect the deformable mirror and modify actuators using TCP-IP protocol

. Go to Utilities tab
. Go to Network panel

. Activate the TCP-IP Server

. Open MATLAB
. Set MATLAB path pointing the folder TCP_IP_PhotonLoop1.5.8.3:.
. Write in MATLAB the command: `+h = PhotonLoopCommunication_lib()+`;
. If everything is set up correctly the TCP-IP server says Connected;

. Now the code below can be run ant it will modify the first actuator of the mirror.
