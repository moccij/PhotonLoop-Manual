An accurate wavefront measurement is the starting point for a succesful adaptive optics correction. 
Follow this tutorial to grasp the basics of wavefront sensing within PhotonLoop.

Sub-optimal measurement settings have a detrimental impact on the correction quality and might lead to an unstable system behavior.

== Configure the sensor

The first step to perform a measurement is to configure the sensor from the {{< ref "widgets//sensor" >}}[*sensor widget*] and visualize it in the {{< ref "widgets//viewfinder" >}}[*viewfinder*].

To open the camera:

. Select the sensor plugin corresponding to the installed camera;
. Open the sensor by clicking on the icon:in_camera[] button;
. Verify that the camera image is correctly shown in the viewfinder widget (ensure that the Show Image button icon:grid_ccd[] is selected);
+

. Select the Cross tool icon:grid_cross[] from the viewfinder and place the cross over the brightest pixels. If the spots are small, zoom into the image by selecting the Zoom tool icon:gridZoom[];
. Inspect the intensity profile from the {{< ref "widgets//intensityprofile" >}}[*intensity profile widget*].

Tune the camera exposure until the maximum acquired intensity is below the intensity saturation limit.

== Configure the centroids extraction parameters

It is crucial to correctly compute the centroids positions for all the spots in the image:

. From the WFS menu, load the WFS profile shipped within the provided camera (such profile contains the calibrated parameters for the WFS camera);
. Select the Draw AoI (Area of Interest) tool icon:grid_resize[] and place the AoI over the target spots. Ensure that the Show Grid button icon:grid[] in the viewfinder is selected: the AoI defines the extraction grid mapping each spot to a lenslet;
+

. Configure the extraction parameters from the {{< ref "widgets//twcog" >}}[*extraction settings widget*]. Ensure that the Show Reference icon:grid_ref[] and Centroids icon:grid_main[] buttons in the viewfinder are selected: adjust the parameters until all the spots are correctly identified;
+

Set the minimum intensity to just above the noise floor. Automatically remove faint lenslets by tweaking the minimum intensity sum.

. Remove the global tilt with the Align Grid icon:grid_align[] tool from the lateral toolbar.

{{% notice tip %}}
On a well aligned optical system, each cell of the grid contains exactly one spot. If this is not the case, it is likely that the optical path introduces defocus. Adjust the optical elements to remove the defocus as much as possible.

Iterate between extraction settings and grid alignment to achieve an optimal measurement.

Show slopes icon:grid_quiver[] in the viewfinder to quickly inspect the wavefront gradient. The arrows are directly proportional to the error between the measured and ideal flat wavefront.

== Reference and Modal Reconstruction

Once the centroids extraction settings are set up, PhotonLoop is ready to measure the wavefront. 

. Start the wavefront measurement by fixing the reference with the Take Absolute Reference icon:ref_abs[] tool from the lateral toolbar. Now, all the modal-related widgets are available;

. If needed, further tweak the modal reconstruction settings from within the {{< ref "widgets//modal" >}}[*modal settings widget*].

The results of wavefront measurements are displayed in the {{< ref "widgets//statistics" >}}[*statistics widget*], along with a summary about the current PhotonLoop settings.
