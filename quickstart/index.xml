Each product from Dynamic Optics is delivered with a USB key containing the principal information (manuals and datasheet, etc..) regarding the purchased products.</description></item><item><title>Wavefront Measurement</title><link>/quickstart/wavefront-measurement.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/quickstart/wavefront-measurement.html</guid><description>An accurate wavefront measurement is the starting point for a succesful adaptive optics correction. Follow this tutorial to grasp the basics of wavefront sensing within PhotonLoop.
Sub-optimal measurement settings have a detrimental impact on the correction quality and might lead to an unstable system behavior.
Configure the sensor The first step to perform a measurement is to configure the sensor from the sensor widget and visualize it in the viewfinder:</description></item><item><title>Aberration Correction</title><link>/quickstart/compensation.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/quickstart/compensation.html</guid><description>PhotonLoop connects to both wavefront sensor and corrector, providing the means of compensating measured aberrations. This tutorial will show how to correctly carry out the AO calibration of the AO system and succesfully close the control loop.
Please read the safety instructions carefully before operating with the WFC.
This tutorial assumes that PhotonLoop is already configured to optimally measure the wavefront. Refer to the wavefront measurement tutorial for how to setup the measurements.</description></item></channel></rss>
