The calibration consists in a series of measurements of a spherical wavefront generated by a laser source at different distances between the SHWFS and source. The setup is very simple:
Measure the spherical wavefront as described in Section 7. Draw a grid about 20x20 in dimensions, the maximum wavefront curvature is in the closest position to the source so be sure that the spots in the border of the considered aperture are inside their cell.</description></item><item><title>WFS Settings</title><link>/widgets/wfs.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/widgets/wfs.html</guid><description>The WaveFront Sensor WFS widget defines the parameters to build the centroids extraction grid and the modal reconstruction.
