In this configuration the AO system is working in closed loop. If the measurements of the wavefront is not used as a control feedback, the system is working in open loop. In the standard setup we offer a deformable lens or mirror controlled by a controller and a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWFS) for the feedback. Relay optical systems are necessary to conjugate all this element with the exit pupil of a generic optical system. The conjugation is very important for accurate measurements of the wavefront and proper AO operation. The relay system is also useful for beam reduction or expansion to adapt it to the clear aperture of the components.\n In the following picture is reported a typical AO setup. Yellow dashed lines represent the conjugated planes.\n \n The exit pupil in the figure is the image of the aperture or stop that limits the marginal ray of the generic optical system. The first relay optics conjugates the exit pupil to the deformable lens and the second relay optics conjugate the lens to lenslet array of the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. The far field camera is not necessary for the AO operation but is usually used to monitor the Point Spread Function (PSF) and allow to have a visual feedback of the AO operation. If the optical system uses a point like source and the AO is working properly, you should see a diffraction limited PSF in the far field camera.\n The AO system with a deformable mirror instead of the deformable lens is very similar to that one reported before, the DM implies a deflection of the beam with a certain angle so, at least two folding static mirrors are necessary in between the first and the second relay optics.\n Closed loop AO operation principle A distorted wavefront comes into the system and is measured with the WFS, the control calculates the correction to feed the deformable element. We obtain a corrected wavefront and in the other side a residual error because new and uncorrelated aberration comes into the system.\n   Non common path aberrations In some cases, also in static configuration, it is not possible to obtain a perfect diffraction limited PSF in the far field camera due to non-common path aberration. This aberration are generated by the optical elements that are not in common between the sensing arm and the far field camera. The effect of non-common path aberrations is that to a flat wavefront does not correspond a diffraction limited PSF on the far field camera. This problem can be solved using better optical elements a careful alignment or setting some aberrations offset in the wavefront sensor controller as described in section10.\n   Physical connections In a standard configuration you need just to connect the controller PZT Mini/Multi and the cameras to computer using the provided USB/Ethernet cable and connect the deformable element to the controller using the multi wire cable. The controller needs an external power supply.\n Deformable elements Deformable elements can be lenses or mirrors. Lenses are composed by thin glass windows with a fluid inside and are actuated by piezoelectric material. Mirror are composed by different reflecting surface depending on the application and piezoelectric actuators. The actuator moves when an electric field is applied. Typical voltage range is in between -62.5V/+125V.\n For more detailed in information see the literature list on:\n https://dynamic-optics.eu/tech.php\n  Shack-Hartmann Wave Front Sensor The device is composed by a camera, typically a CMOS, and a lenslet array. The lenslet array is a series of identical micro lenses. The lenslet array sample in space domain the wavefront and produce a series of spots. The position of the spots center of mass is related to the local wavefront gradient. This information is used to reconstruct the wavefront via interpolation with the derivative of Zernike polynomials.\n The wavefront sensor is characterized by the focal length and the pitch of the lenslets array. These two parameters influence the sensitivity and dynamical range of the sensor.\n For more detailed in information see the literature list on:\n https://dynamic-optics.eu/tech.php\n    How to build your own AO system We list the Thorlabs components that can be used to build your own AO system compatible with Dynamic Optic products.

For these steps you just need to connect the sensor and the controller to the computer with the USB cable. The physical connections are described in details in the next section.\n Connect to the camera To connect the camera of the wavefront sensor follow these steps:\n  Connect the wavefront sensor with the provided USB cable to your PC.

It is important to set the voltage limits to prevent device breakdown. Please note that the PZT Mini is firmware limited according to your deformable mirror/lens limits.\n    Connect the DM or DL to PZT mini using the multi-wire cable. The cable has male connectors and the mirror, lens and controller have female, see picture below respectively for male and female connectors;\n       \n \n     Click on the lens/mirror connection button .\n   Now you can control the actuators voltage from the actuators widgets.\n Table below reports a list of standard settings for some deformable lens and mirror with different controller.\n            Device Controller Driver/Plugin Actuators Minimum Center Maximum     AOL1810\n Pzt-Mini\n UsbHvDriver\n 18\n -0.5\n 0\n 1\n   AOL1816\n Pzt-Mini\n UsbHvDriver\n 18\n -0.8\n 0\n 1\n   AOL1825\n Pzt-Mini\n UsbHvDriver\n 18\n -0.8\n 0\n 1\n   DM6425\n Pzt-Mini\n UsbHvDriver\n 64\n -0.5\n 0\n 1\n   DM12820\n Pzt-Multi\n PZTMulti\n 128\n -0.5\n 0\n 1\n   DM12820\n Pzt-Multi\n Titan\n 128\n 0.25\n 0.5\n 1\n   DM3624\n Pzt-Stack\n UsbHvDriver\n 36\n 0\n 0.375\n 0.75\n   DM1010\n Pzt-Stack\n UsbHvDriver\n 10\n 0\n 0.5\n 1\n    Be sure to insert the correct values, verify in your deformable mirror/lens datasheet the limits of your device.\n      "},{"uri":"/quickstart/wavefront-measurement.html","title":"Wavefront Measurement","tags":[],"description":"","content":"An accurate wavefront measurement is the starting point for a succesful adaptive optics correction. Follow this tutorial to grasp the basics of wavefront sensing within PhotonLoop.\n \n Sub-optimal measurement settings have a detrimental impact on the correction quality and might lead to an unstable system behavior.\n   Configure the sensor The first step to perform a measurement is to configure the sensor from the sensor widget and visualize it in the viewfinder:\n  Select the sensor plugin corresponding to the installed camera;\n  Open the sensor by clicking on the  button;\n  Verify that the camera image is correctly shown in the viewfinder widget (ensure that the Show Image button  is selected);\n\n   Select the Cross tool  from the viewfinder and place the cross over the brightest pixels. If the spots are small, zoom into the image by selecting the Zoom tool ;\n  Inspect the intensity profile from the intensity profile widget.\nTune the camera exposure until the maximum acquired intensity is below the intensity saturation limit.\n   \n      Configure the centroids extraction parameters It is crucial to correctly compute the centroids positions for all the spots in the image:\n  From the WFS menu, load the WFS profile shipped within the provided camera (such profile contains the calibrated parameters for the WFS camera);\n  Select the Draw AoI (Area of Interest) tool  and place the AoI over the target spots. Ensure that the Show Grid button  in the viewfinder is selected: the AoI defines the extraction grid mapping each spot to a lenslet;\n\n   Configure the extraction parameters from the extraction settings widget. Ensure that the Show Reference  and Centroids  buttons in the viewfinder are selected: adjust the parameters until all the spots are correctly identified;\n Set the minimum intensity to just above the noise floor. Automatically remove faint lenslets by tweaking the minimum intensity sum.\n  \n   Remove the global tilt with the Align Grid  tool from the lateral toolbar.\n    On a well aligned optical system, each cell of the grid contains exactly one spot. If this is not the case, it is likely that the optical path introduces defocus. Adjust the optical elements to remove the defocus as much as possible.\n  Iterate between extraction settings and grid alignment to achieve an optimal measurement.\n  Show slopes in the viewfinder to quickly inspect the wavefront gradient.

This tutorial will show how to correctly carry out the AO calibration of the AO system and succesfully close the control loop.\n Please read the safety instructions carefully before operating with the WFC.\n   This tutorial assumes that PhotonLoop is already configured to optimally measure the wavefront. Refer to the wavefront measurement tutorial for how to setup the measurements.\n   Configure the WFC The WaveFront Controller (WFC) is the optical deformable element in charge of the wavefront manipulation. It is managed within the wfc settings widget:\n \n  Connect the WFC to the computer (refer to the installation guide on how to do it);\n  Load the WFC profile from the WFC menù. The profile is shipped along with the provided WFC device;\nDo not load profiles meant for different WFC devices.\n   Only edit the WFC parameters if specifically instructed to do so.\n     Energize the physical device;\n  Open the WFC by clicking on the  button.\n  Apply the Flat Commands  to flatten the WFC.\n   If the steps were succesful, the WFC related widgets are now active. Test the WFC by either performing a relax routine using the Relax  button or manually moving actuators using the actuators bars widget. The WFC response should be observed within the wavefront widget.\n \n   Configure the AO reconstructor The AO system must be calibrated as a whole before attempting to close the control loop. The calibration consists in gathering the actuators response to poke patterns (i.e. interaction matrix), yielding to a map from the WFC shape to the measured wavefront:\n  Check the calibration settings from within the calibration settings widget;\n  Start the calibration with the Perform Calibration  command;\n\n   The resulting actuators responses are shown in the actuators response widget.\n   To map a target wavefront to the WFC shape, the interaction matrix must be pseudo-inverted into the control matrix. PhotonLoop exploits the Singular Values Decomposition (SVD) to reveal the interaction matrix rank and manipulate the resulting system modes:\n   The system modes are shown in system modes widget, whereas the singular values are shown in the system modes bars widget;\n  Advanced reconstructor settings are listed in the reconstructor settings widget.\n   \n From the compensator settings widget, select a compensator plugin and then close the loop with the  command. By default, smaller system modes are removed from the reconstructor, and the compensator gain is low. While such initial parameters were proven to be safe for the average AO system, care must be taken to avoid instabilities.\n   It is possible to tweak the number of considered system modes and the compensator gain to achieve higher temporal and spatial performance. The time series widgets can be consulted to evaluate the performance in real-time.\n \n The correlation graph is shown by entering in the Inspect calibration icon:. This graph reveals graphically the degree of orthogonality of the elements. If the diagonal is well defined it means that we have a good separation.\n Smaller singular values are associated to poorly represented system modes (affected by noise, unreachable) that might cause instabilities and are as such removed from the reconstructor. However, removing too many modes lowers the achievable spatial resolution.\n   You can save the calibration in the log window, when you take a snapshot the control matrix and influence function will be saved in the specified folder. You can load the calibration with Load Calibration button.\n Each mode of the mirror/lens has its own gain that is related to the dynamic range used by the deformable element to generate the mode itself. Low order modes have a higher gain, it means that the system will use a smaller dynamic range to generate that mode. The last modes with a smaller gain belong to high order and they require a lot of dynamic when the deformable element try to reproduce them. Once the Calibration is terminated the program will automatically display the System tab showing the SVD[1] window accessible from the right of the main page.\n \n When the histogram is displayed the modes can be added or removed using the SVD modes selection block:\n   Leave Remove Piston unselected. This setting must be selected before performing the calibration and only in the case of mirrors that integrates the Piezo-Stack technology.\n  Select Remove Global Tilt if you wish to exclude tip-tilt mode from the calibration.\n  System modes are the number of modes selected from the user.\n  SVD threshold set a threshold on the SVD gain in percentage. Below this value the modes are neglected.\n  SVD threshold set a threshold on the SVD gain in percentage. Below this value the modes are neglected.\n  Clicking on Discrete Selection of System Modes the user can remove (restore) selected modes clicking on the bars of the representation with the right (left).\n  Clicking on Reset Selection of System Modes the user will restore all the removed discrete modes.\n   Here in the figure below you can see an example of a System modes diagram without the SVD mode selection (left) and with the SVD threshold set to 10% and some discrete modes eliminated (right).\n  \n In this case is clear that deleting SVD modes reduce considerably the actuators efforts (red bars) but the optical quality of the wavefront is considerably reduced as well. In general, to preserve the optical quality increasing actuators dynamic, it is better to remove only the last SVD modes introducing only a threshold.\n   Closed Loop After the calibration it is possible to close the loop of the adaptive optic system. The wavefront data are used to control the deformable element. Go in the Controller Tab and Compensator Tab and you find the parameters for the controller. The parameters are:\n   Ki is the gain of the control system integrator, it goes from 0 to 1, but it can be forced to be more than one, this may be useful for system with low latency value.\n  Kb is the anti-wind-up of the integrator. It is important when actuators saturate. Without Kb the controller keeps on increase voltages over saturation value. Kb limits this effect deflating the exceeding voltage. In this way the controller is more reactive to exit the saturation zone. Initially set Kb to 0.\n  KAis theintegrator leakage. The controller accumulates numerical errors while is working that cause voltage signal to be more and more high to compensate aberrations. Ka is a loss factors that deflates the integrator to keep the dynamic at the initial value. The cost of this actions is that the control system does not executes perfectly the set point. Initially set Ka to 1.\n   Set the Ki parameter to low value, this is the gain of the closed loop, a high value means fast response of the system but it can also introduce instability.\n \n Be sure that the wavefront measurements is fine and then click on this icon  to start the closed loop operation. The wavefront will be flatten down and you can read the residual RMS in the bottom right part of the main window in the wavefront reconstruction graph. Typical residual RMS value is around 0.04 waves.\n In closed loop is possible to generate Zernike modes. Act on the mode value in the histogram or insert the mode value in the utilities window. The deformable element will produce the indicated mode with a maximum strength defined by the dynamic of the devices. Below we can see the generation of the astigmatism and coma.\n  \n For this figure the wavefront display option in the above figure is set to Real. Change the display option from the panel below the modes representation as described in the next figure.\n \n The display options available to be selected are:\n   Real (It will represent the real state of the wavefront)\n  Both (it will display the wavefront considering the real wavefront with the offset subtracted)\n  Offset (it will display the wavefront considering only the offset introduced by the user)\n     Save flat voltage array and apply to device When you start the closed loop PHOTONLOOP will try to produce a flat wavefront. When this condition is reached it is possible to save the value of actuators (we call it Vflat) that level the deformable optics to zero phase shift. Now click on this icon  and save the actuator value with the snapshot button.\n \n To load the flat voltage array, go to Controller Tab and chose to load () the folder containing file with voltage vector then press Apply Vflat. The flat voltage settings will always be added to start from a better initial wavefront. To remove the voltage flat click again on Apply Vflat. The Vflat array can be used in Open Loop mode where you donÔÇÖt use the wavefront as a control feedback, see next section. Click on Mode offsets or Actuators offset if you want to load the Zernike modes or the Actuators voltages that level the lens, respectively.\n Another way to apply the Vflat is directly applying the actuator offsets from the saved file actuators .txt that can be found in the Vflat folder. In order to do so, go to Utilities then select Actuators Panel and then load () the actuators.txt file present in the Vflat folder. After  is pressed the actuators offset will be applied. And the lens will be flat. This method can be used also to load the actuators voltages for any kind of pre-generated and saved optical deformation of the lens.\n \n   Open Loop If you do NOT have the wavefront sensor start here, (if you have the wavefront sensor skip this section). Go to WFS tab and in the menu of the driver choose File sensor Vx.x. From Version 1.5.1 select Test sensor. Then press the camera connection button and select any white image in .jpg format of any size. Draw a new grid, select a circle aperture and start the measurements. To operate the system without the wavefront sensor feedback you have to upload the preset voltage flat (Vflat) and the influence functions. 1) Load the voltage set of the actuator that flatten the deformable element as describe above. 2) Go to Calibration, press Load calibration and select the folder where your calibration has been saved. The press relax and press open loop button and the wavefront will be flat, see figure below:\n \n Now, as in the case of closed loop, clicking on the green histogram you can change the modes offsets and generate it. Few examples are shown below for coma term (In this measure the wavefront sensor was used only as observer):\n \n and for trefoil:\n \n You can also use the Utilities Modes to select the modes inserting the values manually. The amount are in waves RMS.\n If you have the wavefront sensor start here\n Just click on the open loop button an interact with the Zernike modes histogram to generate the wavefront shape that you desire.\n    1.

First of all, you can find the main toolbox in the left (1) and the Shack-Hartmann image acquisition and display options toolbox on top (2). The first toolbox contains the connection buttons for camera and controller, measurements start/stop and button for the main AO operations such as closed and open loop mode.\n The panel Tab (3) contains four tabs: Settings, Calibrations, Controller and Utilities. In all these tabs you can find many parameters to set. We will explain them during the description of the functions. The space in the center of the window (4) is occupied by images and graphs depending on the tab selected in the right part.\n In the bottom part of the window are displayed the sensor statistics (5), the Zernike decomposition and the value of the selected mode (6), the actuators histogram (7) and the reconstruction of the wavefront (8). The status bar of PHOTONLOOP is displayed in a small horizontal space in the bottom of the window.\n \n The panels 6 and 7 are interactive and you can drag the histograms bars to change their value. In the Zernike coefficients Bar plot (6) it is possible to interact with the Zernike coefficients to add offset coefficients and to select Zernike modes. Set offsets with the left mouse button, reset offsets with the right mouse button and disable measured coefficients with the mouse wheel.\n The actuators histogram (7) is interactive and you can play with the single actuator to set any value. Graphs and various values are displayed when the pointer goes over the bar of the histograms. Offset, coefficient and phase representation of the mode are shown moving the mouse pointer on the bars in the histogram (6); Offsets, values and influence functions[1] are shown moving the mouse pointer on the actuators bar in the histogram (7).\n Also, in the panel 4, where the SHWFS spots are displayed in the WFS Tab, you can interact with measurement grid, the various options will be described in the next section relative to wavefront measurement.\n  Values Widgets  The Values widgets are a family of widgets comprised of: Bars widget; Table widget; Image grid widget. The goal of each widget is to expose values in a meaningful and interactive way. Bars Widget The bars widget shows values and offsets as interactive histogram plots: The wide bars display the current values; The slim bars display the current offsets;\n Calibration Settings  The calibration settings widget exposes the parameters used by the AO calibration routine. The calibration can only be performed once a reference has been taken and a WFC plugin is succesfully opened.

Useful when the actuators exhibit strong non-linear behaviour.\n Compensator Settings  Within the compensator settings widget it is possible to choose the control law, its parameters and additional robustness settings. Available compensators are listed as plugins. Robustness These parameters can help avoiding unexpected behaviors from the AO closed loop operations, such as to shut down the loop when the controller is self-oscillating or the sensor image is partially covered. Item Description Centroids Threshold Halt\n Intensity Profile  The intensity profile widget shows the horizontal intensity profile of the viewfinder image. The horizontal line considered in the intensity profile widget can be set using the cross tool in the viewfinder widget. Within the profile plot are shown various items: The blue curve corresponds to the intensity over the horizontal line; The red curve corresponds to the intensity over the horizontal line that contains the pixel with the maximum intensity in each lenslet;\n Log Toolbar  The log toolbar manages the logging/reporting utility to save both dynamic (real-time) and static data to disk.

Cross tool When this tool is selected, a cross can be set and shown over the image.\n Wavefront  The wavefront widgets show the wavefront reconstructed from the measured modal terms. Refer to the modal settings widget to set the shape and resolution of the reconstructed wavefront. The widgets will be enabled once a valid reference has been taken. Adjusting the wavefront display Hovering over the wavefront widget reveals the settings button that can be clicked to show the widget settings.\n WFC Settings  The WaveFront Corrector WFC widget manages the interface between PhotonLoop and a connected wavefront corrector. Available correctors are listed as plugins. Item Description Plugin Selects the desired plugin. Channels Number of channels to use. Some plugins automatically populate this field with the correct number of actuators. Minimum\n WFS Calibration  The wavefront sensor is delivered with the calibration file that can be loaded in PhotonLoop, and contains all the measured specifications. The calibration consists in a series of measurements of a spherical wavefront generated by a laser source at different distances between the SHWFS and source. The setup is very simple: Measure the spherical wavefront as described in Section 7. Draw a grid about 20x20 in dimensions, the maximum wavefront curvature is in the closest position to the source so be sure that the spots in the border of the considered aperture are inside their cell.\n WFS Settings  The WaveFront Sensor WFS widget defines the parameters to build the centroids extraction grid and the modal reconstruction. Item Description Pixel Size [m] Physical size of the camera pixels. Lenslet Size [m] Physical size of the lenslets of the Shack-Hartmann lenslet array.

The calibration consists in a series of measurements of a spherical wavefront generated by a laser source at different distances between the SHWFS and source. The setup is very simple:\n \n Measure the spherical wavefront as described in Section 7. Draw a grid about 20x20 in dimensions, the maximum wavefront curvature is in the closest position to the source so be sure that the spots in the border of the considered aperture are inside their cell. For this measurement use a square aperture, DO NOT use the circular aperture option.\n PHOTONLOOP has a WFS calibration widget in the Calibration Tab of WFS Parameters window, to open the window click on . To add a point, click on Add Point, insert the measured distances between source and SHWFS (you can use a simple ruler) and press OK. In the table you will see the measured curvature radius and the real one written down before. Take around ten acquisitions at different distances starting from 0.20 m to 1 m.\n \n PHOTONLOOP try to interpolate the data when you add the measurements, all the points should stay along a straight line.
